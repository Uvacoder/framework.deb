# Add all required folder and files to ensure site works

## Background

As a developer I would like to initialize my framework.dev specific framework site so that the rest of the team and contributor can add content to make it useful for the wider community.

## Acceptance

- [ ] Add all Data files
- [ ] Add all Script required for development and production release in package.json

## Notes:
- This ticket is NOT going to tackle the addition of the current site on amplify. This is going to be handled by another ticket.
