# Add framework in amplify config

## Background

Each framework.dev site is deployed from the same codebase using amplify. In this ticket, we are adding this new framework to be added to the amplify config so that it gets deployed correctly

## Acceptance


- [ ] Add the new framework on amplify.yml
- [ ] Test the created PR to make sure that the deployment works as expected


## NOTE:
- You may require someone with AWS access to create the project for you.
