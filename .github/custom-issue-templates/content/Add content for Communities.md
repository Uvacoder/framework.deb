# Add Communities content for framework

## Background

As a visitor of the framework specific Framework.dev site I would like to have the ability to see enough Communities content to keep me informed and find this site to be resourceful and useful.

This should include:
- Slack, discord, reddit
- Conferences (not the actual dates, just the conference sites)
- Meetup (not the actual dates)

## Acceptance


- [ ] Research a list of Communities
- [ ] Add the Communities information in the data files
- [ ] Test each individual look and external link

NOTE:
- This task is timeboxed to a maximum of 4 hours.
